							<li>Analysis of this usage data enables us to make its sites more useful to visitors.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Usage data is not itself personally identifiable information.

						<p>No attempt will be made to identify visitors or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation, or the need to determine details related to a security breach or other inappropriate activity.</p>
